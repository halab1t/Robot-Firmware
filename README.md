# Robot-Firmware

Build a firmware system from scratch to interface with all sensors, motors, and data processing hardware on a robot. The robot was build to go through an obsticle course and detect, pickup, and store treasures found along the course. The obstical course involved 2 ziplines, a line following path, and an infared following path. This functionality was implemented using a series of PID controllers. ![This is our robot!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71194066/197573328-3916afa3-7ff7-423e-8cde-f4230156af38.jpg)
